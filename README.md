# Simon-Game
Simon is a game of memory skill. The game creates a series of tones and lights and requires a user to repeat the sequence. If the user succeeds, the series becomes progressively longer and more complex. Once the user fails or the time limit runs out, the game is over. It is a Front End project made by using HTML,CSS and jQuery 3.1.1
